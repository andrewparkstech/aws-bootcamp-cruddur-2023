# Week 4 â€” Postgres and RDS

## Intro
Week 4 In Progress. I'm behind on the bootcamp but I am working to catch up.

## Progress
- Watched main video and implemented corresponding code
- Watched Ashish's Week 4 security video and took the quiz
- Got the first query working
- Ran into the issue with RDS saying failed to start - but it was still "Configuring enhanced monitoring" so I think the AWS DB health check is just timing out even though the DB is still starting up
- Completed the post confirmation lambda - This was a fun one for me. For the psycopg2 code I looked up the ARN for US East 1: arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:898466741470:layer:psycopg2-py38:2
- Finished up the create activities video so my Crud button is working now
