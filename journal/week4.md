# Week 4 â€” Postgres and RDS

## Intro
Week 4 In Progress.
I'm behind but I am working to catch up.
- Watched main video and implemented corresponding code
- Watched Ashish's Week 4 security video and took the quiz
- Got the first query working
- Ran into the issue with RDS saying failed to start - but it was still "Configuring enhanced monitoring" so I think the AWS DB health check is just timing out even though the DB is still starting up
- Still working on this week...
