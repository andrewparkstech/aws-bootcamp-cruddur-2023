# Week 2 â€” Distributed Tracing

## Intro
Wow! The bootcamp is going full steam ahead and not looking back! That's a good thing as it's forcing me to think and learn. On Week 0, I thought oh this will be easy, I probably won't learn anything. HA! Not so, and again that is a good thing.

## Issues
### Gitpod
Last week I had started using a custom gitpod workspace, but it was just taking too long to load the CDE due to build times and I know that would annoy not only myself but Andrew as well (and whoever assists grading) so I reverted back to using just the gitpod.yml statements to install AWS CLI, etc. I changed the AWS install to a "before" statement insetad of an init statement, and also added a line to remove the zip file when done, after I realized that upon starting the environment, it was getting stuck on a prompt asking if I wanted to overwrite the AWS zip file.

## Homework
So far I have the code from the Week2 video completed. Next in line is:
- Video: observability vs monitoring
- Video: Xray
- Video: CloudWatch
- Homework: other homework that may show once Week2 portal opens
